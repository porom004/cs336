This is just a part of the code for experimentation purpose. 
(From this code : https://github.com/sairajreddy/uci-chess-engine/blob/master/search.cpp)
I made changes as in changing the number of nodes. 
Also, I deliberately removed some search params to observe the behaviour of the code. 
The results were vague, I couldn't present complete explanation in the blog. 
I believe there's a lot can be done when more of this is explored.
